# Morse-Code-Converter
This program is a simple morse code converter app, the text or the morse code inputted will be converted using an public api key, so you don't need to import the api end point, and no api key was needed for this program.<br />
Users can use the UI window to manipulate the data.<br />

The site I got the api from is https://repat.github.io/morsecode-api/ <br />
